# BeatSaberSongListParser
 Parses a folder of info.dat files for Beat Saber custom songs, and returns a list of artists and song titles and mapper(s).
 
 ## This is IN PROGRESS and is not suitable for easy or even working use. However you are welcome to try it out, please create any issues if you happen across any bugs.
 
 - A planned feature that would be really nice is to also grab the !bsr code, from [beatsaver.com](beatsaver.com). However I have no idea how to do this.
